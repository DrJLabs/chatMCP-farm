# PRD Next Steps

1. Review PRD with stakeholders (platform, security, operations) and gather sign-off.
2. Initiate architecture detailing using this document as input.
3. Shard PRD into epics/stories (completed) and socialize with Scrum Master for sprint planning.
4. Align with QA on testing strategy derived from FR/NFR sections.
5. Schedule roadmap checkpoints against Epics 1â€“3 to ensure incremental value delivery.
