# Story 4.2: Filesystem MCP Compose Profile

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** platform engineer maintaining the MCP farm,
**I want** an opt-in docker-compose profile and environment template for the filesystem bridge,
**so that** operators can run the new SSE bridge with read-only defaults without hand-authoring Compose wiring.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `services/filesystem-mcp/compose.yml` defines a `filesystem-mcp` profile that builds the bridge image via `Bridge.Dockerfile`, consumes the service `.env`, attaches to the shared `proxy` network, and registers Traefik labels routing `Host(\`${MCP_PUBLIC_HOST:-fs-mcp.local}\`)` traffic to `SSE_PORT`, remaining opt-in through `scripts/compose.sh`.

2. The compose fragment mounts `${HOST_PROJECTS_ROOT:-/srv/projects}` to `/projects` and `${HOST_VAULTS_ROOT:-/srv/vaults}` to `/VAULTS` with `:ro` defaults, keeps `FS_ALLOWED=/projects:/VAULTS`, and surfaces `ALLOW_WRITE` / `ENABLE_ROOTS` env toggles (default `false`) so write access only activates via deliberate overrides.

3. Container environment configuration in `services/filesystem-mcp/compose.yml` forwards `FS_ALLOWED`, `ALLOW_WRITE`, `ENABLE_ROOTS`, `SSE_PORT`, and resource limits from `.env`, matching the bridge entrypoint expectations recorded in Story 4.1. [Source: docs/stories/4.1.filesystem-mcp-bridge-container.md#acceptance-criteria] [Source: docs/stories/4.1.filesystem-mcp-bridge-container.md#dev-notes]
4. `services/filesystem-mcp/.env.example` lists Keycloak, public URL, network, build context, host root variables, and security toggles (`ALLOW_WRITE=false`, `ENABLE_ROOTS=false`) while instructing operators to keep secrets in `.keycloak-env`, mirroring workspace conventions. [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/filesystem-mcp/epic.md#enhancement-details] [Source: docs/bootstrap-checklist.md#bootstrap-steps] [Source: templates/service/.env.example]
5. Running `scripts/compose.sh --profile filesystem-mcp config` with the new fragment resolves without errors, and `COMPOSE_PROFILES=filesystem-mcp scripts/compose.sh up --build` produces logs confirming the default SSE port and allowed roots; captured evidence is added to Dev Notes along with teardown instructions.

## Dev Notes
- **Previous Story Insights:** Story 4.1 delivered the bridge image, FS_ALLOWED guards, and smoke script expectations—reuse its env names and validation flow so compose wiring remains consistent. [Source: docs/stories/4.1.filesystem-mcp-bridge-container.md#dev-notes]
- **Data Models:** No new persistence; the bridge mounts host paths and streams filesystem content through MCP, so no additional schemas are required. [Source: docs/architecture.md#6-data--integrations]
- **API Specifications:** The bridge exposes Streamable HTTP via `mcp-proxy` on port 12010 and optional roots discovery toggles; compose must surface those entrypoints without altering tool contracts. [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/filesystem-mcp/epic.md#enhancement-details]
- **Component Specifications:** Register the bridge as an opt-in service under `services/filesystem-mcp/` with compose resources, Traefik labels, and external network usage matching other MCP services. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree-reference] [Source: docs/runbooks/compose-and-docs.md#aggregated-compose-workflow]
- **File Locations:** Place compose and env artifacts under `services/filesystem-mcp/`, keep automation scripts in `scripts/`, and avoid touching unrelated service configs. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree-reference]
- **Testing Requirements:** Follow the testing strategy by running compose config checks, smoke tests, and documenting evidence for QA. [Source: docs/architecture.md#9-testing-strategy] [Source: docs/runbooks/compose-and-docs.md#aggregated-compose-workflow]
- **Technical Constraints:** Maintain read-only mounts by default, gate write toggles behind explicit env overrides, and ensure Traefik routing stays consistent with other services on the proxy network. [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/filesystem-mcp/epic.md#risk-mitigation]
- **Project Structure Notes:** Use the existing service template conventions: compose fragment + `.env.example` per service, no direct edits to root `docker-compose.yml`. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree-reference]
- **Compose Profiles:** Keep the bridge opt-in by setting `profiles: [filesystem-mcp]` and documenting activation via `docker compose --profile filesystem-mcp …` or `COMPOSE_PROFILES=filesystem-mcp` so operators stay aligned with Docker's optional service guidance. [Research: Docker Docs – "Enable Optional Docker Compose Services Using Profiles" (accessed 2025-09-25)]
- **No Additional Guidance:** Architecture shards do not define specialized components for filesystem bridges beyond container standards; defer deeper integration docs to Story 4.3. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#containerization]
- **Read-Only Mount Syntax:** Use Compose's long-form volume entries (`type: bind`, `read_only: true`) or `:ro` flags to ensure host paths stay immutable by default, matching Docker's security recommendations for filesystem mounts. [Research: Docker Docs – "Use Long Syntax for Volume Entries in Compose" (accessed 2025-09-25)]

## Testing
- `scripts/compose.sh --profile filesystem-mcp config` to verify the aggregated compose file resolves successfully with the new fragment. [Source: docs/runbooks/compose-and-docs.md#aggregated-compose-workflow]
- `COMPOSE_PROFILES=filesystem-mcp scripts/compose.sh up --build --detach` followed by `docker logs filesystem-mcp-bridge` (or equivalent) to confirm the bridge announces port 12010 and the mounted roots, then `scripts/compose.sh --profile filesystem-mcp down --remove-orphans`. [Source: docs/bmad/focused-epics/filesystem-mcp/epic.md#success-criteria] [Source: docs/runbooks/compose-and-docs.md#aggregated-compose-workflow]
- `scripts/filesystem-mcp-bridge-smoke.sh filesystem-mcp-bridge:local` to validate the pinned `mcp-proxy` version and FS_ALLOWED guardrails still pass with compose-built images. [Source: scripts/filesystem-mcp-bridge-smoke.sh]

## 🔬 Research & Validation Log
- 2025-09-25: Confirmed Docker Compose `profiles` and `COMPOSE_PROFILES` workflow for optional services, reinforcing the story's opt-in compose profile requirement. [Research: Docker Docs – "Enable Optional Docker Compose Services Using Profiles" (accessed 2025-09-25)]
- 2025-09-25: Reviewed Docker guidance on read-only bind/volume mounts and long-form `read_only: true` syntax to back the story's security defaults around `/projects` and `/VAULTS`. [Research: Docker Docs – "Use Long Syntax for Volume Entries in Compose" (accessed 2025-09-25); Docker Docs – "Mount Docker Volume as Read-Only" (accessed 2025-09-25)]

## QA Results
- Gate: PASS (2025-09-25) – documentation, risk profile, and test design confirm the compose profile is ready for development handoff with read-only defaults and explicit override guidance.
- Risks: Track SEC-4.2-001 (write toggles) plus OPS-4.2-001/002 until evidence from P0 test runs captures warning banners, missing mount messaging, and Traefik routing logs; mitigations documented in docs/qa/assessments/4.2-risk-20250925.md.
- Evidence: See docs/qa/assessments/4.2-risk-20250925.md, docs/qa/assessments/4.2-test-design-20250925.md for scenarios and mitigations validated on 2025-09-25.
- Outstanding actions: Execute P0 suite before merge (compose config render, read-only inspect, env propagation, Traefik curl) and attach run logs to Dev Notes.
- Trace/NFR: Added docs/qa/assessments/4.2-trace-20250925.md and docs/qa/assessments/4.2-nfr-20250925.md capturing requirement coverage and PASS decisions across security, performance, reliability, and maintainability.
