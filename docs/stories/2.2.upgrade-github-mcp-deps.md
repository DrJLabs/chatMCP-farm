# Story 2.2: Upgrade GitHub MCP Dependency Stack

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** platform engineer maintaining the GitHub MCP integration,
**I want** to align `services/github-mcp` with the Express 5 and updated MCP SDK stack,
**so that** the service remains in parity with the reference server and avoids dual dependency maintenance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. `services/github-mcp/package.json` and the workspace `package-lock.json` pin `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk@^1.18.1`, `express@^5.1.0`, `zod@^3.24.x`, `supertest@^7.1.x`, `vitest@^3.2.x`, `@vitest/coverage-v8@^3.2.x`, `typescript@^5.6.3`, and `@types/node@^22.9.x`, with all Express 4 artifacts (including `@types/express*`) removed. `npm ls express` and `npm ls @types/express` confirm a single Express 5 tree.

2. Express 5 middleware signatures, async handlers, and error handling compile without type errors across `services/github-mcp/src/server.ts`, `src/mcp.ts`, `src/smoke.ts`, and related utilities while preserving `mcp-auth-kit` wiring. [Source: docs/architecture.md#32-services-services] [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#coding-standards]
3. Vitest 3 migration succeeds: `vitest.config.ts`, tests, and scripts run cleanly on Node 22 via `npm run lint|test|build --workspace github-mcp`, `npm run smoke --workspace github-mcp`, and any workspace aggregate test command introduced during the epic. [Source: docs/architecture.md#9-testing-strategy] [Source: docs/stories/epic-dependency-alignment.md#definition-of-done]
4. Service documentation stays accurate: README, `.env.example`, and compose/runbook notes highlight the Express 5 baseline, enumerate upgraded scripts, capture rollback instructions (pre-upgrade commit or branch), and call out the temporary tech stack mismatch until Story 2.4 updates architecture shards. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree-reference] [Source: docs/stories/epic-dependency-alignment.md#definition-of-done]
5. Any residual follow-ups (e.g., `mcp-auth-kit` peer updates blocking Express 5 type removal) are logged in `docs/stories/follow-ups.md` with owner and target date. [Source: docs/stories/epic-dependency-alignment.md#definition-of-done] [Source: docs/stories/follow-ups.md#open-items]

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Audit current `services/github-mcp` dependency versions, capture the pre-upgrade lockfile hash/branch, and draft rollback guidance for the README (AC: 1, 4). [Source: docs/stories/epic-dependency-alignment.md#epic-description]
- [ ] Bump runtime and dev dependencies in `services/github-mcp/package.json`, regenerate `package-lock.json`, and run `npm dedupe --workspaces` to eliminate Express 4 remnants (AC: 1). [Source: docs/stories/epic-dependency-alignment.md#stories]
  - [ ] Verify `npm ls express --workspace github-mcp` and `npm ls @types/express --workspace github-mcp` show only Express 5 artifacts, capturing evidence for the Dev Agent Record (AC: 1). [Source: docs/stories/epic-dependency-alignment.md#risk-mitigation]
- [ ] Refactor middleware, routers, and error handlers in `src/server.ts`/`src/mcp.ts` for Express 5 async semantics while keeping `mcp-auth-kit` integration intact (AC: 2). [Source: docs/architecture.md#32-services-services] [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#coding-standards]
  - [ ] Update TypeScript typings/imports to leverage Express 5 built-in types and satisfy strict mode (AC: 2). [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md#coding-standards]
- [ ] Upgrade Vitest config, coverage plugin, and test utilities to v3, then run `npm run lint|test|build --workspace github-mcp`, `npm run smoke --workspace github-mcp`, and the workspace aggregate test command to confirm compatibility (AC: 3). [Source: docs/architecture.md#9-testing-strategy] [Source: docs/stories/epic-dependency-alignment.md#definition-of-done]
  - [ ] Document any new scripts or flags introduced by the upgrade in README/testing guidance (AC: 3, 4). [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree-reference]
- [ ] Refresh README, `.env.example`, and compose guidance to reflect Express 5 requirements, rollback hash, and Node 22/24 parity; log follow-ups if blockers remain (AC: 4, 5). [Source: docs/stories/epic-dependency-alignment.md#definition-of-done]
  - [ ] Append any lingering Express 4 peer issues to `docs/stories/follow-ups.md` with owner/due date if Story 2.4 must resolve them (AC: 5). [Source: docs/stories/follow-ups.md#open-items]

## Dev Notes
- **Previous Story Insights:** Story 2.1 updated the MCP test server to Express 5/Vitest 3, noted lingering `@types/express` via `mcp-auth-kit`, and documented rollback hashes plus README calloutsâ€”mirror those verification steps for GitHub MCP to maintain parity. [Source: docs/stories/2.1.upgrade-mcp-test-server-deps.md#dev-notes]
- **Data Models:** Services remain stateless and delegate to downstream APIs; no new persistence is required for this upgrade. [Source: docs/architecture.md#32-services-services]
- **API Specifications:** Preserve Streamable HTTP endpoints, manifest metadata, diagnostics tooling, and OAuth enforcement provided by `mcp-auth-kit`. [Source: docs/architecture.md#21-technical-summary]
- **Component Specifications:** `services/github-mcp` stays on the standard Express + `mcp-auth-kit` stack with middleware ordering (auth, logging, diagnostics) matching architecture guidance. [Source: docs/architecture.md#32-services-services]
- **File Locations:** Core changes land in `services/github-mcp/src/server.ts`, `src/mcp.ts`, `src/smoke.ts`, workspace `package.json`, and service README/.env templates. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md#source-tree-reference]
- **Testing Requirements:** Follow the testing strategy: lint/unit/integration via Vitest + Supertest, smoke Streamable HTTP flows, and capture evidence for CI gating. [Source: docs/architecture.md#9-testing-strategy]
- **Technical Constraints:** Maintain Node `^22 || ^24` engines, strict TypeScript, env validation through `mcp-auth-kit`, and highlight that architecture tech stack shards still list Express 4 until Story 2.4 updates them. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#tech-stack] [Source: docs/stories/epic-dependency-alignment.md#definition-of-done]

## Testing
- Run `npm run lint --workspace github-mcp`, `npm run test --workspace github-mcp`, and `npm run build --workspace github-mcp` after dependency updates. [Source: docs/architecture.md#9-testing-strategy]
- Execute `npm run smoke --workspace github-mcp` to validate Streamable HTTP flows under Express 5. [Source: docs/architecture.md#9-testing-strategy]
- Confirm `npm ls express --workspace github-mcp` and `npm ls @types/express --workspace github-mcp` only report Express 5 artifacts. [Source: docs/stories/epic-dependency-alignment.md#risk-mitigation]
- If a workspace aggregate script exists (e.g., `npm run test --workspaces`), run it to ensure cross-service parity. [Source: docs/stories/epic-dependency-alignment.md#definition-of-done]
