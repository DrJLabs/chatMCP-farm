nfr_validation:
  _assessed: [security, performance, reliability, maintainability]
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Auth guard regression test ensures 401 challenge before stream handling; smoke script logs event-stream payload for auditing.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No additional runtime cost; Vitest 3 execution remains <1s; Express async handlers align with previous footprint.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Build/test/smoke workflows run locally and in root aggregate; CI script updated for Vitest 3 parity.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'README documents rollback hash; coverage thresholds codified in Vitest config; follow-up for auth-kit types tracked.'
