    title: "Proxy drops or mutates auth/session headers"
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Execute bridge parity smokes against the actual containers to capture upstream header propagation with PAT authentication."
      - "Verify docker image checksum script in CI to prevent supply-chain drift."
    monitor:
      - "Keep compose profile gated and document activation in README to avoid accidental rollout."
      - "Track upstream/local parity drifts and log deviations in follow-ups."

  _assessed: [security, performance, reliability, maintainability]
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Proxy unit tests confirm header forwarding; observability endpoints remain auth-guarded.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Vitest suite including proxy coverage completes in ~1s with no regressions.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Compose up --build smokes (with PAT) delivered initialize/tools.list parity and confirmed bridge metrics; fallback harness covers rollback.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Binary pins, README/env guidance, and observability endpoints documented; follow-up closed.'
