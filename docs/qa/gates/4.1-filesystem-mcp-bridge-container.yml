    notes: "Slim runtime (debian-slim + proxy) keeps startup fast; no heavy deps shipped."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Smoke script probes SSE port from inside container, giving automated readiness signal."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Shared manifest suite and smoke script keep drift low; manifest helper centralised."
