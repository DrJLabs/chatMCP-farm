    title: "Template dependency matrix drifting from Express 5 baseline"
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Keep template `package.json` and configs diffed against `services/mcp-test-server` before release."
      - "Retain `npm ls express --workspace <scaffold>` evidence in Dev Agent Record for each template refresh."
    monitor:
      - "Benchmark Vitest coverage runtime as more scaffolds adopt V8 AST-aware remapping."
      - "Re-run smoke after mcp-auth-kit updates to confirm guard ordering remains intact."
