# PO Validation: Story 4.2

Date: 2025-09-25
Reviewer: Sarah (Product Owner)

## Inputs Reviewed
- Story 4.2 Draft – `docs/stories/4.2.filesystem-mcp-compose-profile.md`
- QA Risk Profile – `docs/qa/assessments/4.2-risk-20250925.md`
- QA Test Design – `docs/qa/assessments/4.2-test-design-20250925.md`
- QA Gate Summary – `docs/qa/gates/4.2-filesystem-mcp-compose-profile.yml`

## Checklist
- [x] Acceptance criteria cover compose profile definition, read-only mounts, env propagation, `.env.example`, and evidence capture aligned with filesystem MCP epic
- [x] Risks documented with owners/mitigations, highlighting SEC-4.2-001 and operational mount/routing follow-ups
- [x] Test design enumerates P0 bring-up scenarios plus override warnings and smoke coverage
- [x] QA gate records PASS with outstanding evidence items; story QA Results mirror those expectations
- [x] Outstanding actions (compose profile implementation, P0 evidence capture, trace doc) explicitly listed under QA Results / recommendations

## Outcome
- **Verdict:** READY FOR DEVELOPMENT (GO)
- **Notes:** Development must create `services/filesystem-mcp/compose.yml`, `.env.example`, and script wiring before execution of the P0 suite. Do not enable `ALLOW_WRITE`/`ENABLE_ROOTS` outside controlled tests; capture warning-banner evidence when toggles are exercised. Update trace and NFR assessments after implementation.

## Next Steps
1. Hand off Story 4.2 to the development agent with emphasis on maintaining read-only defaults and documenting compose evidence in Dev Notes.
2. After implementation, rerun PO validation checklist to confirm trace/NFR updates and QA evidence are attached before release.
3. Track SEC-4.2-001 mitigation in follow-up log if write access pilots are requested.
