# QA Review: Story 4.3 – Filesystem MCP Runbook & Validation Docs

Date: 2025-09-25  
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary
- Decision: PASS – Documentation deliverables satisfy acceptance criteria with supporting QA artifacts (risk, test design, trace, NFR) and reviewer scans show no regressions.
- Confidence: High – Evidence captured via manual verification (`rg` cross-link checks, reviewer smoke pipeline) and structured runbook content.
- Residual Risks: SEC-4.3-001 (write-toggle governance) monitored; documentation mitigates with approval workflow and evidence logging.

## Findings
- **Strengths**
  - Runbook consolidates operational steps with clear evidence capture requirements (§4), reducing onboarding time.
  - Security posture explicitly references SEC-4.2-001 and mandates PO/QA approvals before enabling writes (§5).
  - Cross-references in compose/bootstrap runbooks prevent drift and ensure discovery during bring-up.
- **Risks / Actions**
  - Maintain manual discipline for approval workflow until automation enforces keyword presence (`ALLOW_WRITE=true`). Tracked via recommendation in NFR assessment.
  - Encourage future automation to store validation outputs (compose config/logs) with story artifacts to streamline audits.

## Evidence Reviewed
- Risk profile: `docs/qa/assessments/4.3-risk-20250925.md`
- Test design: `docs/qa/assessments/4.3-test-design-20250925.md`
- Trace matrix: `docs/qa/assessments/4.3-trace-20250925.md`
- NFR assessment: `docs/qa/assessments/4.3-nfr-20250925.md`
- Reviewer artifacts: `artifacts/reviewer/20250925T234253Z/`
- Runbook & story updates: `docs/runbooks/filesystem-mcp.md`, `docs/stories/4.3.filesystem-mcp-runbook.md`

## Gate Recommendation
- Update QA gate to PASS with notes on residual monitoring (SEC-4.3-001) and automation follow-ups.

## Follow-up Items
1. Evaluate adding markdown lint for approval workflow keywords (tracked in NFR assessment).
2. Capture compose/log/smoke outputs during first production enablement and attach to QA artifacts.
