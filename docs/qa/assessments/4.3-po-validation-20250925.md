# PO Validation: Story 4.3

Date: 2025-09-25
Reviewer: Sarah (Product Owner)

## Executive Summary
- Status: CONDITIONALLY READY (pending runbook draft + QA gate closure)
- Confidence Score: 8/10
- Key Risks: Approval workflow clarity (SEC-4.3-001), documentation execution evidence, dependency alignment with Stories 4.1/4.2

## Validation Checklist

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Story Statement & Value | ‚úÖ | Captures operator value (faster bring-up, fewer rediscovery loops) aligned with filesystem MCP epic goal. |
| Acceptance Criteria Coverage | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Clear and testable, but runbook deliverable not yet implemented; ensure AC1‚ÄìAC3 map to concrete sections before handoff. |
| Dependencies | ‚úÖ | References Stories 4.1/4.2 deliverables and focused-epic documentation; no open blockers noted. |
| Cross-Doc Alignment | ‚úÖ | Dev Notes guard against scope creep and cite relevant shards (tech stack, source tree, prior stories). |
| Tasks/Subtasks Quality | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Tasks comprehensive but mark completion status once runbook/updates land; ensure doc updates tracked via PR checklist. |
| QA/Research Hooks | ‚úÖ | Risk profile and test design completed; explicit links documented in QA Results. |
| Definition of Ready | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Missing evidence of doc execution; require draft runbook + cross-link diffs prior to dev agent pickup. |

## Findings & Recommendations
1. **Runbook completeness (AC1/AC2/AC3)** ‚Äì Before moving to development, produce initial `docs/runbooks/filesystem-mcp.md` draft capturing configuration, security posture, and validation evidence. Ensure the documentation includes explicit callouts for SEC-4.2-001 approval workflow.
2. **Evidence capture** ‚Äì Incorporate template or checklist in the runbook for logging compose `config`, logs, smoke script output, and approvals; integrate with QA test design scenario 4.3-INT-003.
3. **Task tracking** ‚Äì Update story tasks or Dev Notes once doc updates to `compose-and-docs.md` and `bootstrap-checklist.md` are merged so downstream agents see accurate status.
4. **Handoff readiness** ‚Äì After the runbook draft exists, re-evaluate QA gate (CONCERNS) and flip story status to `Approved` only when SEC-4.3-001 mitigations verified.

## Decision
- **Conditionally Ready** ‚Äì Do not advance to development until runbook deliverables are drafted and QA gate passes. PO sign-off contingent on seeing documentation PR with linked story reference.

## Required Follow-Up
- [ ] Produce filesystem runbook draft satisfying AC1‚ÄìAC3.
- [ ] Attach evidence (compose `config`, logs, smoke script output) to QA gate once P0 tests execute.
- [ ] Re-run QA gate; update story status to `Approved` after PASS decision.

## üî¨ Research & References
- Reviewed focused epic instructions to confirm Documentation scope (docs/bmad/focused-epics/filesystem-mcp/epic.md).
- Referenced Story 4.2 compose profile deliverable for security defaults and toggles (docs/stories/4.2.filesystem-mcp-compose-profile.md).
- Checked architecture testing strategy to align evidence expectations (docs/architecture.md#9-testing-strategy).
