# PO Validation: Story 1.2

Date: 2025-09-22
Reviewer: Sarah (Product Owner)

## Inputs Reviewed
- Story 1.2 Draft – `docs/stories/1.2.oauth-manifest-tool-behavior.md`
- QA risk profile – `docs/qa/assessments/1.2-risk-20250922.md`
- QA test design – `docs/qa/assessments/1.2-test-design-20250922.md`
- Follow-up log – `docs/stories/follow-ups.md`

## Checklist
- [x] Acceptance criteria align with epic goals and include stub compatibility path
- [x] Risks scoped appropriately with mitigation owners (BUS-001 downgraded to High)
- [x] Test design covers manifest, diagnostics, and optional connector smoke with Vitest/Supertest tooling
- [x] Documentation plan notes README updates and curl workflow
- [x] Follow-up recorded for deferred stub tooling if needed

## Outcome
- **Verdict:** READY FOR DEVELOPMENT (GO)
- **Notes:** Development may choose to implement stubs in-story or defer via `docs/stories/follow-ups.md` with explicit owner/date. Ensure README update highlights how to toggle stub tools. No other blockers identified.

## Next Steps
1. Assign Story 1.2 to Development agent with emphasis on env-driven manifest updates and diagnostics payload.
2. If stubs deferred, populate follow-up entry with owner/target date before closing the story.
3. QA to prepare automation harness (Vitest + Supertest) ahead of dev handoff.
