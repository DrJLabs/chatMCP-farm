# PO Final Validation: Story 2.4

Date: 2025-09-24
Reviewer: Sarah (Product Owner)

## Inputs Reviewed
- Story 2.4 (Ready for Review) – `docs/stories/2.4.upgrade-mcp-auth-kit-peers.md`
- QA gate – `docs/qa/gates/2.4-upgrade-auth-kit.yml`
- QA risk profile – `docs/qa/assessments/2.4-risk-20250924.md`
- QA test design – `docs/qa/assessments/2.4-test-design-20250924.md`
- Test evidence – terminal logs from:
  - `npm run build --workspace packages/mcp-auth-kit`
  - `npm run postbump:test`
  - `POSTBUMP_NODE_VERSION=20.18.0 node scripts/postbump-test.mjs`
  - `npm ls express --workspaces`
  - `npm ls @types/express --workspaces`
- Documentation diffs – `README.md`, `packages/mcp-auth-kit/README.md`, `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`, `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`, `docs/stories/follow-ups.md`

## Checklist
- [x] All acceptance criteria satisfied; Express 5/Jose 6 peers applied, helper script present, docs updated, follow-up closed.
- [x] QA gate = PASS with no waivers outstanding.
- [x] Test evidence covers unit/integration scenarios plus runtime guard failure case for unsupported Node versions.
- [x] Documentation reflects new baseline and operator guidance; follow-ups log moved to “Closed.”
- [x] Story Dev Agent Record populated with commands, completion notes, and file list.

## Findings
- Workspace `npm run postbump:test` executes cleanly on Node 22, confirming regression coverage, while simulated Node 20.18 run fails fast with clear guidance.
- Architecture shards now reference Express 5; coding standards warn against reintroducing legacy async wrappers.
- README additions ensure teams know when/how to run the post-bump helper and the minimum Node version expectations.
- No open risks remain; OPS monitoring focuses on ensuring CI adopts the helper script.

## Outcome
- **Verdict:** READY FOR RELEASE (GO)
- **Notes:** Merge once code review completes. Coordinate CI owners to add `npm run postbump:test` to dependency bump workflows.

## Next Steps
1. Submit PR for Story 2.4 branch (`feat/story-2-4-auth-kit`).
2. Update CI pipelines to invoke the new helper automatically after dependency changes.
3. Monitor initial runs for runtime guard feedback and adjust messaging if necessary.
