# PO Validation: Story 1.1

Date: 2025-09-21
Reviewer: Sarah (Product Owner)

## Inputs Reviewed
- Story draft: `docs/stories/1.1.scaffold-mcp-test-server.md` (v0.2)
- Epic context: `docs/stories/epic-mcp-test-server.md`
- QA artifacts: `docs/qa/assessments/1.1-risk-20250921.md`, `docs/qa/assessments/1.1-test-design-20250921.md`
- Architecture shards: `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`, `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`, `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`

## Template Compliance
- All required story template sections present (Status, Story, Acceptance Criteria, Tasks/Subtasks, Dev Notes, Testing, Change Log, Dev Agent Record, QA Results).
- No unfilled placeholders or template tokens detected.
- Change Log includes current revision history.

## Critical Issues (Must Fix before Dev)
- None identified. Story is structurally complete and aligns with epic intent.

## Should-Fix Improvements
1. **Clarify OAuth flow assumption (blocking follow-up)**: Story notes an open question about whether ChatGPT integration will require Authorization Code + PKCE vs. client credentials. Add explicit acceptance criterion or dependency pointing to Story 1.2 so devs know this story proceeds with client-credentials-only scaffold. (Links to Research Log open question.)
2. **Highlight lint/test command expectations in Tasks**: Tasks reference running workspace lint but do not mention adding minimal smoke script placeholders (even if deferred). Consider adding a note that smoke scripts arrive in Story 1.3 to avoid confusion when checking AC5.

## Nice-to-Have Improvements
- Provide explicit example values for `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in README guidance (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:3000`) to speed onboarding.
- Suggest adding acceptance criteria language for rollback documentation to mirror risk mitigation plan.

## Anti-Hallucination Review
- All technical claims trace back to architecture shards or referenced external specs (MCP transport, Keycloak, Docker Compose). No invented libraries observed.
- File paths (`services/mcp-test-server/...`) match documented source tree.

## Acceptance Criteria Coverage Check
- Tasks map cleanly to AC1â€“AC6 via explicit markers.
- QA test design covers each AC with appropriate levels; no uncovered acceptance criteria.

## Testing & Risk Alignment
- Testing section reiterates smoke script expectations; QA plan introduces seven scenarios addressing identified risks (SEC-001, TECH-001, OPS-001, SEC-002). No additional gaps surfaced.

## Final Assessment
- **Verdict:** GO (story ready for development once should-fix clarifications are applied).
- **Implementation Readiness Score:** 8 / 10
- **Confidence Level:** Medium-High (pending resolution of OAuth flow dependency note).

## Follow-Up Actions
1. Update Story 1.1 Dev Notes or Acceptance Criteria to clarify OAuth flow assumption and reference upcoming Story 1.2 decision.
2. Acknowledge in Tasks or Change Log that smoke scripts will land in later story to prevent double work.
3. Incorporate onboarding examples for `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` when authoring README (can be done during implementation but track in Change Log).
