Date: 2025-09-22
Reviewer: Sarah (Product Owner)

## Inputs Reviewed
- Story 1.3 (status Done) – `docs/stories/1.3.compose-integration-runbook.md`
- QA Gate (PASS) – `docs/qa/gates/1.3-compose-integration-runbook.yml`
- QA assessments – `docs/qa/assessments/1.3-risk-20250922.md`, `docs/qa/assessments/1.3-test-design-20250922.md`, `docs/qa/assessments/1.3-trace-20250922.md`, `docs/qa/assessments/1.3-nfr-20250922.md`
- Test evidence – `npm run build --workspace mcp-test-server`, `npm run test --workspace mcp-test-server`, `npm run lint`
- Follow-up items – risk profile recommendations (compose config CI, secret-handling automation), Developer Mode staging smoke reminder

## Checklist
- [x] Acceptance criteria addressed in story/tasks with documentation and smoke tooling updates
- [x] QA gate reviewed; guardrails verified via `npm run guard`
- [x] NFR assessment reviewed (all attributes PASS after guardrails)
- [x] Traceability matrix reviewed; Developer Mode staging run noted as remaining gap
- [x] Test evidence verified (build/test/lint commands executed successfully)

## Outcome
- **Verdict:** APPROVED (GO)
- **Notes:** Guardrails (`npm run guard`) enforce compose profile isolation and secret sourcing. Developer Mode staging smoke remains on the monitoring calendar.

## Next Steps
1. Schedule Developer Mode staging smoke (quarterly cadence) per risk profile recommendation.
2. Maintain guardrail scripts in CI prior to release.
