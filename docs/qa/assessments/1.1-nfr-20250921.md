# NFR Assessment: Story 1.1

Date: 2025-09-21
Reviewer: Quinn (QA)

## Scope
Evaluate non-functional readiness of the MCP Test Server scaffold focusing on security, reliability, performance, operability, and maintainability prior to integration testing.

## Findings

### Security
- OAuth enforcement uses existing `mcp-auth-kit` with bearer-token requirement. `.env.example` keeps secrets out of VCS and instructs referencing `.keycloak-env`. (GOOD)
- Origin enforcement defaults to `127.0.0.1` with explicit overrides; 403 response path exercised. Need follow-up once wider origins introduced (watch Story 1.2). (GOOD, monitor)
- Recommendation: enable automated secret scanning (gitleaks/ggshield) in CI per risk profile SEC-001. (ACTION: CI task backlog)

### Reliability & Availability
- Compose profile remains opt-in and includes healthcheck plus resource limits (256M cap) to avoid starving Keycloak. (GOOD)
- Service relies on in-memory session map; acceptable for test harness. Document restart impact (sessions reset) in README after Story 1.2. (MONITOR)

### Performance
- Single Express instance; CPU limit 0.50 ensures fairness. For high-load validation not required. (GOOD)
- Logging via `morgan` minimal; ensure DEBUG_HEADERS disabled by default (already false). (GOOD)

### Operability & Observability
- Health endpoint `/healthz` returns structured JSON. Add to runbook for monitoring. (GOOD)
- Startup log states bind host, port, allowed origins for quick audit. (GOOD)
- Recommendation: Add structured log integration with existing logging framework once service promoted beyond test harness. (FUTURE)

### Maintainability
- README documents setup, compose profile, and future work, including smoke script deferral. (GOOD)
- Story 1.1 explicitly references follow-on stories for OAuth flow decisions ensuring tracked dependencies. (GOOD)

## Risk Summary
- No critical NFR gaps identified; residual items tracked in backlog (CI secret scan, README session impact, logging enhancements if promoted).

## Decision
- **NFR Gate:** PASS (test harness-ready). Proceed with planned QA execution. Re-evaluate before production exposure or origin expansion.
