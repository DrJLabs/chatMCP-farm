Date: 2025-09-24
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary
- Security: PASS — Express 5 upgrade maintains auth guard ordering; new Supertest case confirms 401 challenge before Streamable transport handling; smoke script now logs event-stream payload for audit.
- Performance: PASS — No additional hot-path work; Express 5 async routing matches previous footprint and Vitest 3 runs remain sub-second.
- Reliability: PASS — Build/test/smoke suite executed post-upgrade; `scripts/cloud-test.sh` enforces parity in CI environments.
- Maintainability: PASS — README documents rollback hash and toolchain expectations; Vitest config centralizes coverage thresholds.

Quality Score: 95/100

## Critical Issues
None.

## Quick Wins
- Track `@types/express` removal within Story 2.4 to fully eliminate legacy type surfacing in dependency tree.
