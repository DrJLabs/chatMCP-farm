# NFR Assessment: 3.1 – GitHub MCP Bridge Integration

Date: 2025-09-25  
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

- Security: PASS – Proxy unit tests assert Authorization/session header forwarding and observability endpoints remain auth-guarded; PAT handling documented in `.env.example`.
- Performance: PASS – Vitest suite (including new proxy coverage) completes in ~1.0s (`npm run test --workspace github-mcp` 2025-09-25), no latency regressions introduced.
- Reliability: PASS – Profile bring-up exercised the built images (`COMPOSE_PROFILES=github-mcp ./scripts/compose.sh up --build -d`), with in-container initialize/tools.list parity hitting GitHub MCP upstream and metrics confirming steady-state; fallback harness still returns 406/400 when upstream disabled.
- Maintainability: PASS – Bridge pins, env guidance, and Dev Agent Record updates clarify upgrade process and follow-up closure; observability endpoints expose health/metrics for operators.

## Evidence & Notes

### Security
- `services/github-mcp/test/proxy.spec.ts` ensures Authorization and `mcp-session-id` headers survive the proxy hop and that observability routes honour auth guard configuration.
- `.env.example` and README warn that PATs must be scoped and stored outside VCS; bridge wrapper logs remain on private volume.

### Performance
- `npm run test --workspace github-mcp` (2025-09-25) completes in under 1s with the added proxy tests.
- No additional network hops introduced for fallback mode; upstream path remains internal-only via compose network.

### Reliability
- Profile-based smoke validated healthy startup: `COMPOSE_PROFILES=github-mcp ./scripts/compose.sh up --build -d` (with PAT configured) followed by in-container initialize/tools.list calls produced GitHub tool catalog responses.
- Bridge metrics endpoint reported `bridge_process_up 1`, `bridge_process_restarts_total 0`; fallback harness (bridge disabled) still documented expected 406/400 responses for rollback confidence.

### Maintainability
- Binary pins (`GITHUB_MCP_SERVER_VERSION`, `MCP_PROXY_VERSION`) recorded in `.env.example` and Dev Agent Record; observability follow-up closed with `/observability/bridge/{logs,status}` endpoints documented.
- README captures rollback instructions (unset `MCP_UPSTREAM_URL`, stop bridge) and metrics URLs for ongoing operations.

## Quick Follow-ups
- Continue to capture parity artefacts (initialize + tools.list transcripts and metrics snapshot) in future releases; readiness now demonstrated with PAT-sourced upstream.
