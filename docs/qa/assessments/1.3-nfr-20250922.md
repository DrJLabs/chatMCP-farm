# NFR Assessment – Story 1.3

Date: 2025-09-22  
Reviewer: Quinn (QA)

## Summary
- Assessed Attributes: security, performance, reliability, maintainability
- Status: PASS (security), PASS (performance), PASS (reliability), PASS (maintainability)
- Quality Score: 100/100

## Findings

### Security – PASS
- Evidence: `scripts/check-inline-secrets.mjs` blocks inline secrets and deprecated flags; `scripts/healthcheck.sh` now requires env-sourced credentials (`KC_CLIENT_SECRET`), and README/runbook reinforce `.keycloak-env` sourcing. Header enforcement remains covered by automated tests (`services/mcp-test-server/test/accept-header.spec.ts`).
- Gap: None (residual monitoring via guard script in CI).

### Performance – PASS
- Evidence: No runtime code paths altered beyond logging; `npm run build/test` succeeded, maintaining existing performance profile. Smoke tooling remains lightweight; no additional latency-critical work introduced.

### Reliability – PASS
- Evidence: `scripts/healthcheck.sh` now asserts `Mcp-Session-Id` and Accept headers, improving observability. Updated smoke script reports protocol details; unit/integration tests confirm header behavior, supporting transport reliability.

### Maintainability – PASS
- Evidence: Dedicated `tsconfig.build.json` keeps build output clean; documentation refreshed across runbook/README/`.env.example`. Test suite extended with header assertions for regression safety.

## Gate Snippet
```yaml
nfr_validation:
  _assessed: [security, performance, reliability, maintainability]
  security:
    status: PASS

  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No runtime regressions introduced; build/test pipeline remains green.'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Healthcheck and smoke tooling now log required MCP headers for observability.'
