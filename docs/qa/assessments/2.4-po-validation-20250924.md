# PO Validation: Story 2.4

Date: 2025-09-24
Reviewer: Sarah (Product Owner)

## Inputs Reviewed
- Story 2.4 Draft – `docs/stories/2.4.upgrade-mcp-auth-kit-peers.md`
- QA risk profile – `docs/qa/assessments/2.4-risk-20250924.md`
- QA test design – `docs/qa/assessments/2.4-test-design-20250924.md`
- Epic reference – `docs/stories/epic-dependency-alignment.md`
- Architecture shards – `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`, `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`, `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`
- Follow-ups log – `docs/stories/follow-ups.md`

## Checklist
- [x] Story status, story statement, and acceptance criteria follow the template with no placeholders.
- [x] Acceptance criteria align with epic scope and explicitly capture Express 5 peers, `jose@^6.1.0`, documentation updates, and post-bump helper requirements.
- [x] Tasks/subtasks cover each AC, reference architecture sources, and include runtime guard + dual-node verification subtasks.
- [x] Dev Notes summarize relevant architecture guidance and prior story learnings; dependency update nuances (Node 20.19+ requirement) are called out.
- [x] Testing section matches QA test design scenarios (build, `npm ls`, postbump helper executions) and cites strategy document.
- [x] Research log entries provide modern references (Express 5 async behaviour, `jose` v6 release, npm workspaces guidance).
- [x] Follow-ups entry already exists to close Express 4 type warnings; owner/target documented.

## Findings
- Story cleanly captures the sequence for updating peers, publishing docs, and adding the regression helper. Subtasks differentiate Node 22 and Node 20.19+ executions, matching QA risk mitigations (SEC-001, OPS-001).
- Acceptance criteria require architecture shard updates and README migration notes, keeping documentation debt visible.
- Dev Notes and Research log consolidate the engineering rationale; developers should not need to reopen architecture shards for core context.
- QA artifacts provide clear guardrails (9 test scenarios with 6×P0 coverage). No additional PO adjustments needed prior to handoff.

## Outcome
- **Verdict:** READY FOR DEVELOPMENT (GO)
- **Implementation Readiness Score:** 9/10
- **Confidence Level:** High – Story, risks, and test design supply actionable guidance for the dev agent to execute without ambiguity.

## Next Steps
1. Assign Story 2.4 to development once branching is prepared; ensure coordination with Story 2.2 hand-off to retire Express 4 warnings promptly.
2. During implementation, capture postbump helper execution evidence for Node 22 and Node 20.19+ in Dev Notes.
3. Update follow-ups log when Express 4 peer warning is resolved to close the tracked item.
