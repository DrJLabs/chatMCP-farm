# PO Validation: Story 1.3

Date: 2025-09-22
Reviewer: Sarah (Product Owner)

## Inputs Reviewed
- Story 1.3 Draft – `docs/stories/1.3.compose-integration-runbook.md`
- Epic context – `docs/stories/epic-mcp-test-server.md`
- QA risk profile – `docs/qa/assessments/1.3-risk-20250922.md`
- QA test design – `docs/qa/assessments/1.3-test-design-20250922.md`
- Research log embedded in story (Docker Compose profiles, MCP transport, Developer Mode guidance)

## Checklist
- [x] Acceptance criteria align with epic goal of delivering opt-in compose orchestration, smoke automation, and ChatGPT handoff.
- [x] Tasks map to ACs and enumerate concrete file/script updates (runbook, README, `.env.example`, compose fragment, automation checks).
- [x] Dev Notes summarize all required technical references (Compose profiles, MCP headers, OpenAI Developer Mode) with traceable citations.
- [x] Risk profile mitigations (TECH-001, SEC-001) are reflected in story tasks and documentation requirements.
- [x] Test design scenarios cover compose dry-run, smoke headers, connector validation, regression scripts, and align with P0 priorities.
- [x] Follow-up triggers (e.g., future Developer Mode changes) documented via risk monitoring guidance.

## Findings
- Story is self-contained; no missing template sections or unresolved placeholders observed.
- Documentation updates emphasize secret handling and teardown reminders, addressing SEC-001/OPS-001 risks.
- Acceptance criteria remain testable with explicit success evidence (config outputs, smoke headers, connector enablement results).

## Outcome
- **Verdict:** READY FOR DEVELOPMENT (GO)
- **Notes:** Ensure the README/runbook edits explicitly call out sourcing `.keycloak-env` in subshells to avoid shell history leaks, mirroring story guidance. No blockers identified.

## Next Steps
1. Assign Story 1.3 to development with emphasis on documenting `--profile` vs `COMPOSE_PROFILES` usage and secret handling.
2. Coordinate with QA to schedule compose "config" dry-run and smoke automation once docs update PR is ready.
3. Add quarterly reminder (calendar/task board) to revalidate ChatGPT Developer Mode instructions per risk profile recommendation.
