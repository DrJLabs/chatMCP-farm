# NFR Assessment: 4.2 – Filesystem MCP Compose Profile

Date: 2025-09-25  
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary
- Security: PASS – Compose profile enforces read-only mounts by default, logs explicit warnings when `ALLOW_WRITE`/`ENABLE_ROOTS` toggles flip, and `.env.example` instructs operators to obtain PO/QA approval before enabling writes.
- Performance: PASS – Bridge bring-up under the new profile starts within seconds (`COMPOSE_PROFILES=filesystem-mcp scripts/compose.sh up --build --detach`), and smoke validation confirms `mcp-proxy 0.9.0` responds on port 12010 without additional latency-inducing hops.
- Reliability: PASS – Profile config, runtime bring-up, override sandbox, and smoke script collectively validate startup, warning paths, and teardown; guardrails reject empty `FS_ALLOWED` and ensure socket availability before service announcement.
- Maintainability: PASS – Compose fragment mirrors shared template conventions, `.env.example` documents overrides, and Dev Agent Record references the executed validation steps for future repeats.

## Evidence & Notes

### Security
- `docker inspect ...` showed both `/projects` and `/VAULTS` mounts with `RW=false`; override run emitted mandatory warnings before exiting when toggles enabled.
- `.env.example` outlines approval workflow and keeps write/root flags false by default, reducing accidental privilege escalation.

### Performance
- `COMPOSE_PROFILES=filesystem-mcp scripts/compose.sh up --build --detach` built and started the bridge container in ~30s including Rust compilation; subsequent starts reuse the cached image and initialize instantly.
- `scripts/filesystem-mcp-bridge-smoke.sh chat-mcp-farm-filesystem-mcp-bridge` verifies socket availability on port 12010, demonstrating readiness without extra proxy layers.

### Reliability
- Config render (`scripts/compose.sh --profile filesystem-mcp config`) ensures aggregated compose stays stable.
- Override smoke (`timeout 5 docker run … ALLOW_WRITE=true ENABLE_ROOTS=true`) exercises warning path and clean shutdown, while the main smoke script covers version pins and readiness checks; teardown via `scripts/compose.sh --profile filesystem-mcp down --remove-orphans` left no dangling containers.

### Maintainability
- `services/filesystem-mcp/compose.yml` follows existing service patterns (opt-in profile, shared proxy network, Traefik labels) and documents env forwarding inline.
- `.env.example` centralizes operational knobs and matches story/test design IDs, aiding future audits and updates.

## Quick Follow-ups
- Add automated check ensuring `.env.example` retains `ALLOW_WRITE=false` / `ENABLE_ROOTS=false` and read-only mounts when future updates occur.
