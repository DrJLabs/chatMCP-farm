# PO Validation: Story 2.1

Date: 2025-09-24
Reviewer: Sarah (Product Owner)

## Inputs Reviewed
- Story 2.1 Draft – `docs/stories/2.1.upgrade-mcp-test-server-deps.md`
- Epic context – `docs/stories/epic-dependency-alignment.md`
- QA risk profile – `docs/qa/assessments/2.1-risk-20250924.md`
- QA test design – `docs/qa/assessments/2.1-test-design-20250924.md`
- Embedded research log covering Express 5.1 migration, Vitest 3 guidance, and npm rollback practices

## Checklist
- [x] Acceptance criteria map directly to epic Story 2.1 objectives (dependency pinning, Express 5 migration, Vitest 3 validation, documentation updates).
- [x] Tasks reference concrete files/commands (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `src/app.ts`, Supertest suites, README) with AC linkage and rollback instructions.
- [x] Dev Notes summarize technical context (middleware order, testing strategy, engine constraints) with traceable architecture citations and call out Express 4 doc drift to address in Story 2.4.
- [x] Risk mitigations (TECH-001/002, OPS-001, TECH-003) are reflected in tasks and testing requirements.
- [x] Test design scenarios cover dependency hygiene, auth middleware regression, Vitest 3 runs, workspace aggregate script, and rollback dry-run.
- [x] Research log confirms modern best practices (Express async handlers, Vitest CLI, npm rollback) and outstanding doc updates.

## Findings
- Story is template-complete; no missing sections or placeholders.
- Acceptance criteria are measurable with explicit success evidence (command outputs, passing suites, documentation updates).
- Task sequencing enforces baseline snapshot capture before dependency changes, reducing rollback risk per OPS-001.
- Documentation notes flag Express 4 reference gap for follow-up Story 2.4, aligning with epic DoD.

## Outcome
- **Verdict:** READY FOR DEVELOPMENT (GO)
- **Implementation Readiness Score:** 9/10
- **Confidence Level:** High
- **Notes:** During implementation, capture the baseline lockfile hash in README exactly as described and ensure README documents how to re-run the new aggregate test script once Story 2.4 introduces global doc updates.

## Next Steps
1. Assign Story 2.1 to development, emphasizing Express 5 middleware validation and Vitest 3 regression coverage.
2. Coordinate with QA to schedule the workspace aggregate test run in CI once dependencies are bumped.
3. Prepare to update the architecture tech stack shard in Story 2.4 to resolve Express 4/5 documentation mismatch noted in Dev Notes.
