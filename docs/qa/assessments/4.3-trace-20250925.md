Date: 2025-09-25  
Analyst: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Coverage Summary
- Total Requirements: 4
- Fully Covered: 4 (100%)
- Partially Covered: 0 (0%)
- Not Covered: 0 (0%)

### Requirement Mappings

#### AC1 – Runbook documents prerequisites, configuration, and bring-up workflow referencing Bridge.Dockerfile and `.env`
- **Coverage:** Full
- **Evidence / Tests:**
  - `docs/runbooks/filesystem-mcp.md` §1–§3 detail prerequisites, configuration table (FS_ALLOWED, ALLOW_WRITE, ENABLE_ROOTS, SSE_PORT, host roots), and the compose bring-up workflow citing `scripts/compose.sh --profile filesystem-mcp config/up` and `Bridge.Dockerfile`. (4.3-UNIT-001, 4.3-INT-001)
  - Manual verification with `rg "Bridge.Dockerfile" docs/runbooks/filesystem-mcp.md` confirms explicit linkage back to Story 4.1 deliverables.

#### AC2 – Runbook captures security posture and approval workflow for write/roots toggles
- **Coverage:** Full
- **Evidence / Tests:**
  - `docs/runbooks/filesystem-mcp.md` §2 (configuration table) and §5 (Enabling Write Mode) explain defaults, approval checklist, and evidence logging referencing SEC-4.2-001. (4.3-UNIT-002, 4.3-INT-002)
  - QA review validated presence of PO/QA approval steps and callouts to document before/after configuration in follow-ups.

#### AC3 – Validation steps enumerate compose dry-run, logs, smoke script, and teardown evidence capture
- **Coverage:** Full
- **Evidence / Tests:**
  - `docs/runbooks/filesystem-mcp.md` §4 lists compose config, logs, smoke script, teardown, and instructions to store evidence in Dev Notes/QA artifacts. (4.3-INT-003, 4.3-E2E-001)
  - Reviewer artifacts `artifacts/reviewer/20250925T234253Z/` demonstrate smoke tooling remains healthy post-documentation change.

#### AC4 – Supporting runbooks/checklists cross-reference the filesystem runbook
- **Coverage:** Full
- **Evidence / Tests:**
  - `docs/runbooks/compose-and-docs.md` added filesystem runbook reference under Tips; `docs/bootstrap-checklist.md` smoke test step directs operators to the new guide. (4.3-UNIT-003, 4.3-E2E-002)
  - Verified via `rg "filesystem-mcp.md" docs/runbooks docs/bootstrap-checklist.md` showing both links.
