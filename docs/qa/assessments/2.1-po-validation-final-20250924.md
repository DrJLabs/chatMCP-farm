# PO Final Validation: Story 2.1

Date: 2025-09-24
Reviewer: Sarah (Product Owner)

## Inputs Reviewed
- Story 2.1 (Ready for Review) – `docs/stories/2.1.upgrade-mcp-test-server-deps.md`
- QA risk profile – `docs/qa/assessments/2.1-risk-20250924.md`
- QA test design – `docs/qa/assessments/2.1-test-design-20250924.md`
- Traceability matrix – `docs/qa/assessments/2.1-trace-20250924.md`
- NFR assessment – `docs/qa/assessments/2.1-nfr-20250924.md`
- QA gate summary – `docs/qa/gates/2.1-upgrade-mcp-test-server-deps.yml`

## Checklist
- [x] All acceptance criteria satisfied or explicitly noted as partial with mitigation (AC1 partial due to shared auth-kit types; scheduled for Story 2.4).
- [x] Risk profile mitigations aligned with implementation plan (Supertest auth regression, Vitest 3 coverage, rollback hash documentation).
- [x] Test design scenarios executed or planned; aggregate workspace run captured in completion notes.
- [x] NFR assessment confirms QoS posture unchanged post-upgrade.
- [x] QA gate = PASS with monitored item logged.

## Findings
- Express 5 upgrade validated without regressions; documentation now advertises rollback hash and toolchain expectations.
- Remaining dependency hygiene risk (auth-kit `@types/express`) is outside the story scope; confirmed next story in epic owns resolution.

## Outcome
- **Verdict:** READY FOR RELEASE (GO)
- **Notes:** Ensure Story 2.4 updates `mcp-auth-kit` peers promptly to retire Express 4 typing; add CI check referencing `npm ls @types/express` once Story 2.4 lands.

## Next Steps
1. Merge Story 2.1 implementation once code review completes.
2. Kick off Story 2.2 for GitHub MCP service parity with Express 5 toolchain.
3. Track Story 2.4 to close remaining Express 4 type dependency.
