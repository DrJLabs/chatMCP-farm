# NFR Assessment: 4.3 – Filesystem MCP Runbook & Validation Docs

Date: 2025-09-25  
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary
- Security: PASS – Runbook reiterates read-only defaults, references SEC-4.2-001, and embeds an approval workflow plus evidence capture for any write/root enablement.
- Performance: PASS – Documentation preserves the opt-in compose profile workflow without adding runtime overhead; validation steps rely on existing smoke tooling with negligible additional latency.
- Reliability: PASS – Checklist covers dry-run, bring-up, log verification, smoke harness, and teardown, ensuring operators verify service readiness and rollback paths.
- Maintainability: PASS – Runbook consolidates operational knowledge with explicit cross-links from compose and bootstrap guides, reducing drift and duplicative instructions.

## Evidence & Notes

### Security
- §2 configuration table defaults `ALLOW_WRITE`/`ENABLE_ROOTS` to `false` and warns against modifications without PO/QA approval.
- §5 approval workflow instructs teams to log before/after configuration and update `docs/stories/follow-ups.md`, aligning with architecture risk guidance.

### Performance
- Bring-up instructions mirror existing compose commands; no new services introduced. Reviewer scan confirms smoke script remains fast (runtime < 21s for full pipeline) and unchanged by documentation updates.

### Reliability
- Validation checklist itemizes compose config, logs, smoke script, and teardown, giving operators reproducible steps to verify service health and exit cleanly.
- Troubleshooting section documents common failure scenarios (missing networks, empty FS_ALLOWED, routing misconfiguration) with actionable remediation.

### Maintainability
- Linking compose and bootstrap runbooks to the filesystem guide centralizes instructions, minimizing divergence.
- Dev Notes and QA Test design reference ensure future updates track evidence expectations and cross-document dependencies.

## Quick Follow-ups
- Consider automating markdown lint checks to confirm approval workflow keywords remain present in future revisions.
