- Reviewer Scan – `artifacts/reviewer/20250925T202909Z/`
- Implementation Evidence – compose logs, smoke script output, override warnings captured in Dev Agent Record

## Checklist
- [x] Acceptance criteria satisfied with checked-in compose fragment, `.env.example`, and validation notes.
- [x] QA artifacts (risk, test design, trace, NFR, gate) updated post-implementation with PASS decisions and monitored risks.
- [x] Reviewer pipeline rerun clean after Semgrep config fix; no blocking findings.
- [x] Dev Agent Record documents completed tasks, validation commands, and file list for traceability.
- [x] Outstanding follow-ups limited to operational monitoring (write-toggle approvals) and optional automation noted in gate.

## Verdict
- **READY FOR RELEASE** – Compose profile implementation meets epic goals with documented evidence and governance hooks. No additional PO actions required before PR/merge.

## Notes
1. Track automation backlog item to assert `.env.example` retains read-only defaults (QA gate monitoring).
2. Ensure operators capture warning-banner evidence when enabling write/root toggles during pilots; document in runbook if rollout proceeds.
