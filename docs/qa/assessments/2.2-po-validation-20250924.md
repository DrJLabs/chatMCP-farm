# PO Validation: Story 2.2

Date: 2025-09-24
Reviewer: Sarah (Product Owner)

## Inputs Reviewed
- Story 2.2 Draft – `docs/stories/2.2.upgrade-github-mcp-deps.md`
- QA risk profile – `docs/qa/assessments/2.2-risk-20250924.md`
- QA test design – `docs/qa/assessments/2.2-test-design-20250924.md`
- Epic reference – `docs/stories/epic-dependency-alignment.md`
- Architecture shards – `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`, `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`, `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md`

## Checklist
- [x] Story sections complete per template; no placeholders remain.
- [x] Acceptance criteria mirror epic scope and are testable.
- [x] Tasks/subtasks cover each AC and reference architecture sources.
- [x] Dev Notes cite architecture specs and highlight Express 5/Vitest 3.2 considerations.
- [x] Testing section aligns with QA test design scenarios.
- [x] Follow-up plan addresses pending `mcp-auth-kit` peer updates.

## Findings
- Express 5 async handler removal is clearly captured in tasks and Dev Notes; risk of legacy helpers resurfacing documented via QA scenarios.
- README/rollback dependencies noted, but call out to update tech stack shard remains in Story 2.4—ensure coordination during implementation.
- Follow-ups file entry required when the story lands; current draft instructs this appropriately.

## Outcome
- **Verdict:** READY FOR DEVELOPMENT (GO)
- **Implementation Readiness Score:** 8/10
- **Confidence Level:** High – Story + QA artifacts provide sufficient context for dev agent execution.

## Next Steps
1. Assign Story 2.2 to development once branch prep is complete.
2. Coordinate with Story 2.4 owners regarding `mcp-auth-kit` peer update timing.
3. Ensure follow-ups entry is created/updated during implementation (tracks SEC-201 mitigation).
