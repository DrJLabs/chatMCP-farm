Date: 2025-09-24
Reviewer: Sarah (Product Owner)

## Inputs Reviewed
- Story 2.2 (Ready for Review) – `docs/stories/2.2.upgrade-github-mcp-deps.md`
- QA risk profile – `docs/qa/assessments/2.2-risk-20250924.md`
- QA test design – `docs/qa/assessments/2.2-test-design-20250924.md`
- QA gate summary – `docs/qa/gates/2.2-upgrade-github-mcp-deps.yml`
- Follow-ups log – `docs/stories/follow-ups.md`

## Checklist
- [x] All acceptance criteria satisfied; residual Express 4 peer warning tracked as follow-up for Story 2.4.
- [x] Risk mitigations align with QA recommendations (Supertest coverage, workspace tests, rollback hash recorded).
- [x] Test evidence captured: lint/test/build, smoke run, and aggregate workspace tests reported in Dev Notes.
- [x] Documentation updated (README, follow-ups) to reflect Express 5 baseline and interim warnings.
- [x] QA gate = PASS with monitored item documented.

## Findings
- Workspace alignment complete for GitHub MCP; temporary npm peer warning is documented with owner/target in follow-ups.
- Diagnostics enhancements (rate limit propagation) improve observability and align with QA risk recommendations.
- README now guides operators through rollback hash usage and highlights temporary warning acceptance until Story 2.4 lands.

## Outcome
- **Verdict:** READY FOR RELEASE (GO)
- **Notes:** Merge once code review completes; coordinate Story 2.4 to retire Express 4 peers and close monitored gate item.

## Next Steps
1. Proceed with PR review/merge for Story 2.2 implementation.
2. Kick off Story 2.4 to publish `mcp-auth-kit` peer updates.
3. Monitor CI for `npm ls express` warnings until Story 2.4 resolves the shared peer dependency.
