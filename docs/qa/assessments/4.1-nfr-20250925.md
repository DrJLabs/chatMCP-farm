# NFR Assessment: 4.1

Date: 2025-09-25
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS — Container defaults to read-only mounts, rejects unsafe `FS_ALLOWED` values, and never enables write/root access without explicit opt-in.
- Performance: PASS — Bridge remains lightweight; smoke build confirms startup latency is negligible and no heavy dependencies ship in runtime.
- Reliability: PASS — Updated smoke script now probes the SSE port from inside the container, providing an automated readiness check.
- Maintainability: PASS — Dockerfile refactor centralises manifest helper, smoke script exercises version pinning, shared test suites reduce drift, and documentation guards prevent command divergence.

## Critical Issues

- None. Automated smoke validation now covers prior readiness concern.

## Quick Wins

- Integrate the smoke script into CI to prevent regressions before release.
- Optionally add an HTTP health check once upstream bridge exposes `/healthz`.
