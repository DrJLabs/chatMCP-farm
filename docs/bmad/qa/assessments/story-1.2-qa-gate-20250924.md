| ---------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Acceptance Criteria Coverage | PASS   | Persona agent, pipeline artifacts, strict/dry-run modes, and telemetry sync verified through story tasks and metrics. |
| Sanitization & Secrets       | PASS   | Redaction metrics recorded; pipeline blocks on unresolved secrets per sanitization report.                            |
| Observability                | PASS   | Telemetry event appended to rollout tracker; schema validation ensures SARIF/report JSON integrity.                   |
| NFR Compliance               | PASS   | Runtime 32.72 s < 180 s target; artifacts hashed per run to prevent collisions.                                       |
| Traceability                 | PASS   | Story → risk/test docs → QA evidence linked; README cross-references pipeline usage and rollback procedure.           |

## Residual Risks

- Strict-mode false positives monitored during pilot (tracked in rollout tracker).

## Decision

- **Gate Result:** PASS
- **Confidence:** High — Persona pipeline runs reproducibly with sanitization, telemetry, and rollback controls in place.

## Recommendations

1. Review telemetry after first strict-mode pilot to adjust confidence thresholds if needed.
2. Keep sanitization regex list updated as new secret patterns surface during adoption.
