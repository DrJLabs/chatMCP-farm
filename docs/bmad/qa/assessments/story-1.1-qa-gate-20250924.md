| Area                         | Status  | Notes                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Acceptance Criteria Coverage | PASS    | All ten ACs satisfied; scripts, configs, cache mirroring, and documentation delivered with evidence in artifacts. |
| Test Readiness               | PASS    | Seven scenarios defined across unit/integration/E2E; metrics validation command now part of QA workflow.          |
| Risk Mitigation              | PARTIAL | Runtime/cache alerts captured in metrics; CI enforcement still pending (tracked follow-up in risk profile).       |
| NFR Compliance               | PASS    | Telemetry confirms runtime 26.22s < 180s target and cache 4.48MB < 250MB cap.                                     |
| Traceability                 | PASS    | Story → tests → artifacts mapping verified via updated Story QA Results and rollout tracker entry.                |

## Residual Risks

- None; follow-up items closed 2025-09-24.

## Decision

- **Gate Result:** PASS
- **Confidence:** High — Tooling enforced in CI; prune fixtures automated.

## Recommendations

1. Monitor reviewer CI job runtime and adjust ignore rules if run time exceeds 180s threshold.
2. Track reviewer artifacts and false-positive rates in docs/bmad/issues/reviewer-rollout.md after each run.
